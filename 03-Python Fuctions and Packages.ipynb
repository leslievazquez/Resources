Unlike functions or methods they are complete programs which we can plug in to our code at the right time to produce a specific output. Each script is a module which contains functions, methods and types which as just mentioned are aimed at solving particular problems.  \n",

    "To install a package we need to use PIP. PIP is a package maintenance system for Python. Go to https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ for more information on installing PIP for your particular operating system. It's worth pointing out here that if you download Python directly from the Python website and are using versions Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 then you already have PIP installed. If you installed Python as part of the Anaconda data science platform then you may need to install PIP. \n",

The exact line is _python3 get-pip.py_. When PIP is installed you can use it to install any Python package that you need. For example by typing the line _pip3 install numpy_ into your terminal or command prompt you will install the NumPy package. When typing \"python\" at the command line we use \"python3\" and \"pip3\" to tell our system that we are working with version 3 of Python.\n",

To do this we need to import the package or one of its modules into our programs using the import statement, **import numpy**. When working with large datasets NumPy is a package that we will be using a lot. One common function of NumPy is **array**. When working with NumPy we cannot simply say \"array([1,2,3]), we need to tell Python that we want to make use of the array function from NumPy. Take a look."

This might seem more convenient right now when our program is three lines long but imagine 1000 or 2000 lines of code and your array is at line 1456. Will you know then that your array is referring to a numpy array? What if you share your program with a colleague? How will she know that this array is a NumPy array? Every time you or your colleague need to check you will have to scroll to the top of your program to see how you imported NumPy. Not very efficient. You will quickly loose context as your programs get longer and for this reason using _\"import numpy as np\"_ is the preferred option. "
